            <hr>
            <p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles.[3] He is the only child of Irmelin (née
                Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor
                of comic books.[4] DiCaprio's father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent.[5][6][7]
                DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German.[8] His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken
                (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915–2008),[9] was a Russian-born German citizen.[10][11] In an interview in Russia,
                DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said that two of his late grandparents were Russian.[12]
                DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.[5]</p>
            <p>DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi
                museum in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked.[13] His parents separated when he was a year old, and he
                lived mostly with his mother.[14] The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and
                Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several
                jobs.[5] DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a
                few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years.[15] He dropped
                out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).[16][17]
                DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is
                conversant in German and Italian.[18][19][20]</p>

            <h3 id="1979–1990">1979–1990: Career beginnings</h3>
            <p>In 1979, DiCaprio was removed, at the age of five, from the set of the children's television series Romper Room
                for being disruptive.[21][22] He began his career by appearing in several commercials and educational films,
                following his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, and landing an ad at age 14 for
                Matchbox cars by Mattel, which he considered his first role.[21][23] Throughout his teens he was seen in
                commercials for Kraft Foods, Bubble Yum, Apple Jacks, and many more.[24] In 1989, he played the role of Glen
                in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie.[25][25]</p>
            <p>In 1990, he started acting regularly on television. This started with a role in the pilot of The Outsiders, and
                one episode of the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell.[26][27] That same year, DiCaprio
                got a break on television when he was cast in Parenthood. A series based on a successful comedy film by the
                same name. His works that year earned him two nomination at the Young Artist Award in Best Young Actor in
                a Daytime Series (Santa Barbara) and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series (Parenthood).[28][29][30]
                DiCaprio was also a celebrity contestant on the children's game show Fun House. One of the stunts he performed
                on the show was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.[31][32]</p>

            <p>In 1991, he played an un-credited role in one episode of Roseanne.[33] Later that year, DiCaprio's debut film
                role was in the comedic science fiction horror film Critters 3, in which he played the stepson of an evil
                landlord, a role that DiCaprio described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair."[34] Released
                in March that year, the movie went direct-to-video.[34][35] Shortly after, he became a recurring cast member
                on the successful ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver
                family.[36][21] DiCaprio was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television
                Series.[37]
            </p>
            <p>In 1992, alongside Drew Barrymore, Sara Gilbert, Tom Skerritt, and Cheryl Ladd, he played a supporting role in
                the first installment of the Poison Ivy film series. It was nominated for the 1992 Grand Jury prize of Best
                Film at the Sundance Film Festival and received a nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards.[38] In 1992,
                DiCaprio was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in This Boy's Life
                adapted from Tobias Wolff's memoir of the same name. He played opposite De Niro, who was acting as his stepfather,
                and Ellen Barkin as his mother. The film was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and released in 1993.[21] In
                1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of Johnny Depp's character in What's Eating
                Gilbert Grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallström admitted he
                was initially looking for a less good-looking actor but finally settled on DiCaprio as he had emerged as
                "the most observant actor" among all who auditioned.[34] Budgeted at US$11 million,[39] the film became a
                critical success, resulting in various accolades for DiCaprio, who was awarded the National Board of Review
                Award and nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal. The New York Times
                critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio's performance, writing "the film's real show-stopping turn comes from
                Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch.
                The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end."[40]</p>
            <p>DiCaprio's first effort of 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious
                over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself.[41]
                The film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and
                received mixed reviews from critics.[42] He next starred in Agnieszka Holland' Total Eclipse, which he co-lead
                with David Thewlis. The feature is a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur
                Rimbaud (DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (Thewlis). He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production
                on the project.[43] A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical
                run.[44] His last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, co- starring Lorraine Bracco, James Madio,
                and Mark Wahlberg. It is a biographical film, in which DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll in his teenage years as
                a promising high school basketball player and writer who developed an addiction to heroin with his misguided
                friends.[45] In 1996, DiCaprio appeared opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, an abridged
                modernization of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean
                dialogue. The project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million.[46] Later that year, he starred
                in Jerry Zaks' family drama Marvin's Room, reuniting with Robert De Niro. Based on Scott McPherson's screenplay
                adaptation of his own 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl
                Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement.[47] DiCaprio portrayed
                Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum for setting fire to his
                mother's house.[48]</p>

            <p>In 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin
                man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio initially refused to
                portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed
                in his acting ability.[49] Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film to
                date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.84 billion in box-office
                receipts worldwide,[50] and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship
                among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as "Leo-Mania".[51] In May 1998, for example,
                his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among
                the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[52] More than 200 fans contacted the Academy
                of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest him not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards.[53] He
                was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success
                of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: "I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and
                what my face became around the world ... I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect
                to. It's not something I'm going to try to achieve either."[54]</p>

            <p>The following year, DiCaprio played a self-mocking role in a small appearance in Woody Allen's caustic satire
                of the fame industry, Celebrity (1998). It features an ensemble cast that consists of Kenneth Branagh, Judy
                Davis, Winona Ryder, Melanie Griffith, Joe Mantegna, Charlize Theron, Hank Azaria, Famke Janssen, Donald
                Trump, etc.[55]</p>
            <p>That year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin
                brother Philippe in Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite
                receiving a rather mixed to negative response,[56] the film became a box office success, grossing US$180
                million internationally.[57] Though DiCaprio's performance was generally well-received, with Entertainment
                Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman writing that "the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely old enough to
                be playing anyone with hormones, but he's a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel,"[58]
                he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.[59]</p>
            <p>DiCaprio's next project was the drama film The Beach (2000), an adaption of Alex Garland's 1996 novel of the
                same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island
                commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $ US 50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing
                $ US 144 million worldwide,[60] but as with DiCaprio's previous project, the film was negatively reviewed
                by critics.[61] Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that "Richard [DiCaprio's role] is too much the American Everyman
                and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio,
                while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from
                nowhere a dimensional character."[62] The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work
                on the film.</p>
            <p>In the mid 1990s, DiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, as a favor to aspiring
                director R. D. Robb.[21] When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however,
                DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended
                to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom.[21] The film
                eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics.[63]</p>
            <h3 id="2002–2009">2002–2009: Continued success and producing</h3>
            <p>DiCaprio's first film of 2002 was in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film set in the mid-19th
                century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea
                of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader
                of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project.[64] Nonetheless production
                on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month
                shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made.[64] Upon its release, Gangs
                of New York became a financial and critical success.[65] DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed
                by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.[66][67][68]</p>
            <p>Also in 2002, DiCaprio appeared the biographical crime drama film Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank
                Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several different personas,
                to make millions in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147
                different locations in only 52 days, making it "the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making" DiCaprio
                had experienced yet.[69] Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international
                success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide.[70]
                Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while "DiCaprio, who in recent films ... has played dark
                and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and
                does it."[71] The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the
                film.[72][73]

            <p>In 2004 DiCaprio took his first producing task in Niels Mueller' The Assassination of Richard Nixon, as one of
                the executives.[74] It stars Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson and Naomi Watts, and is based on the story
                of would-be assassin Samuel Byck, who plotted to kill Richard Nixon in 1974. It received a Un Certain Regard
                nomination at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It won and was nominated for many Awards in the festival circuit.[75]
                Forging a collaboration with Scorsese, the two paired again for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American
                film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the
                late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing
                it after working on back-to-back biopics; Ali and The Insider.[67] The actor eventually pitched John Logan's
                script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success.[76]
                DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving
                another Academy Award nomination.[77][78]</p>
            <p>In 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture
                for his contributions to the arts.[79] The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and The
                Departed. In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is
                involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews,[80] and DiCaprio
                was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate.[81]</p>

            <p>n Scorsese's The Departed he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish
                Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one
                of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006.[82] Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio
                and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviator's previous record of US$213.7
                million.[83] DiCaprio's performance in The Departed was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award
                for Best Supporting Actor.[84] The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated
                DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned
                his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.[85][86][87]</p>
            <p>In 2007, DiCaprio produced Gardener of Eden directed by Kevin Connolly. It stars Lukas Haas, Erika Christensen
                and Giovanni Ribisi. The film is about Adam Harris (Haas), a twenty-something college dropout lacking real
                direction in his life. Adam's life changes dramatically when he accidentally captures a serial rapist. The
                new-found attention inspires him to become a vigilante. Shortly after saw the release of The 11th Hour. A
                documentary film which he created, produced, co-written and narrated. With contributions from over 50 politicians,
                scientists, and environmental activists, including former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, physicist Stephen
                Hawking, Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai, journalist Armand Betscher, and Paul Hawken, the film documents
                the grave problems facing the planet's life systems. Global warming, deforestation, mass species extinction,
                and depletion of the oceans' habitats are all addressed. The film's premise is that the future of humanity
                is in jeopardy. The film proposes potential solutions to these problems by calling for restorative action
                by the reshaping and rethinking of global human activity through technology, social responsibilityand conservation.</p>
            <p>In 2008, DiCaprio starred in Body of Lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius,
                set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist
                organization, and each other.[88] Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts
                for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s
                such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975).[88] The film received mixed reviews
                from critics,[89] and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115
                million worldwide.[90] Later that year, DiCaprio reunited with Kate Winslet to film the drama Revolutionary
                Road (2008), directed by Winslet's then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic
                films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation
                of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that
                plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster.[91] Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost
                immediately into production.[92] He noted that he saw his character as "unheroic" and "slightly cowardly"
                and that he was "willing to be just a product of his environment."[93] Portraying a couple in a failing marriage
                in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves
                for Revolutionary Road, which eventually earned them favorable reviews.[94] For his portrayal DiCaprio garnered
                his seventh Golden Globes nomination.[95] Also in 2008, he was a creator and an executive producer for Greensburg
                an American television series broadcast on the Planet Green television network. The show takes place in Greensburg,
                Kansas, and is about rebuilding the town in a sustainable way after being hit by the May 2007 EF5 tornado.
                He was a producer for the psychological horror thriller film Orphan directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. The film
                stars Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Isabelle Fuhrman, C. C. H. Pounder and Jimmy Bennett. The plot centers
                on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl.</p>

            <h3 id="2010–present">2010–present: Current works</h3>
            <p>DiCaprio continued his collaborative streak with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island
                (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy"
                Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island and comes to question his own sanity.
                The film grossed $294 million.[96] Also in 2010, DiCaprio starred in director Christopher Nolan's science-fiction
                film Inception, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe,
                Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation,[97] DiCaprio
                portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an "extractor" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information
                that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting
                an idea in a corporate target's mind.[98] DiCaprio was "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion
                and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life."[99] Released to
                critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide.[100] To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed
                to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives
                money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million
                from the film to become his highest payday yet.[101] The movie went on to become Di Caprio's second highest-grossing
                movie with $293 million at the box office, after Titanic with $659 million and ahead of The Revenant with
                $184 million.[102]</p>

            <p>In 2011, DiCaprio starred alongside Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, a biopic about
                J. Edgar Hoover.[103] Written by Dustin Lance Black, the film focuses on the career of the FBI director from
                the Palmer Raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.[104]
                Reviews towards the film were mostly mixed, with many critics commending DiCaprio's performance but feeling
                that, overall, the film lacked coherence.[105] Roger Ebert praised DiCaprio's performance as a "fully-realized,
                subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than Hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself."[106]
                Also in 2011, he produced Catherine Hardwicke' Red Riding Hood. It's a romance horror film very loosely based

                While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming despite

                DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating,
                "As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance – haloed by
                fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue"—DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character.
                He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker,
                a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, "old sport," a verbal tic that stumped other actors.
                It's a tremendous, hard-won performance."[116] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance
                as Gatsby as "The movie's greatest and simplest special effect," and states "This is an iconic performance—maybe
                his career best."[117] The film grossed $348 million worldwide[118] and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing
                film.[119]</p>

                DiCaprio Foundation in 1998, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.[168]
                Although concerned with all areas of the environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving Earth's biodiversity
                and supporting renewable energy. It has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short
                web documentaries, Water Planet and Global Warning.[169] The foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.[170][171]
                Because of his active involvement in those causes, he has received praise from environmental groups.[172]
                Among the accolades received were the Martin Litton Environment Award, in 2001, from Environment Now, and
                the Environmental Leadership Award in 2003 from Global Green USA.[173] He has been an active supporter of
                numerous environmental organizations and has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA,
                International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Natural Resources Defense Council.[169][174]</p>
            <p>DiCaprio is a vegetarian,[175] rumored to even be vegan,[176] and in 2014 he backed the documentary Cowspiracy
                about the impact of animal agriculture on the environment and the positions of several environmental organizations

                is powered by solar panels,[172] although his use of private jets and large yachts has attracted criticism
                due to their large carbon footprints.[181][182] DiCaprio states that global warming is the world's "number-one
                environmental challenge".[183] DiCaprio chaired the national Earth Day celebration in 2000, where he interviewed
                President Bill Clinton and they discussed plans to deal with global warming and the environment.[184] In
                2007 he had a major role in The 11th Hour, a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global
                warming. He co-produced, co-wrote and narrated the film.[184] From a benefit "11th Hour" fine art auction
                he organized in 2013, he has raised nearly $40 million towards his foundation. He told attendees, "Bid as
                if the fate of the planet depended on us."[185] It became the world's highest-grossing environmental charity
                event ever held.[186]</p>

                Awards had incorporated environmentally intelligent practices in its production. He presented at the 2007
                American leg of Live Earth, and in 2010 his environmental work earned DiCaprio a nomination for the VH1 Do
                Something Award, honoring people who do good.[187] In November 2010, DiCaprio donated $1 million to the Wildlife
                Conservation Society at Russia's tiger summit. DiCaprio's persistence in reaching the event after encountering
                two plane delays caused then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to describe him as a "muzhik" or "real man".[188][189]
                In 2011, DiCaprio joined the Animal Legal Defense Fund's campaign to free Tony, a tiger who has spent the
                last decade at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse Tête, Louisiana.[190] In 2014 he was appointed as a United

                the UN Climate Summit.[191][192] He again spoke at the UN in April 2016 prior to the signing of Paris Climate
                Change Agreement.[193]</p>
            <p>In early 2016, at a meeting with Pope Francis, he gave a charity donation and spoke about environmental issues.
                A few days later, possibly influenced by his meeting with DiCaprio, the Pope said he would act in a planned
                faith-based charity film, Beyond the Sun. It would be his first acting experience, and would also be the
                first time in history that a Pope appeared in a feature film. Profits from the film would be given to charities
                in Argentina.[194] In July 2016, his foundation awarded $15.6 million to help protect wildlife and the rights
                of Native Americans, along with combating climate change.[195] In July 2017, a charity auction and celebrity
                concert put on by the foundation had raised over $30 million in its opening days and was set to continue
                the following month.[196] In October 2016, DiCaprio joined forces with Mark Ruffalo in North Dakota in support
                of the Standing Rock tribe's opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. He traveled to Indonesia in early
                2016 where he criticized the government's palm oil industry's slash-and-burn forest clearing methods.[197][198]
                That same year, he executive-produced and appeared in Before the Flood, a 2016 documentary film examining
                various aspects of global warming.[199] In accepting his Best Actor award at the 2016 Oscars ceremony, DiCaprio
                stated:</p>
            <p>Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and
                we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world
                who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the
                world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this.
                For our children's children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics
                of greed.[200]</p>
            <p>In April 2017, he promoted and protested President Trump's inaction on climate change by attending the 2017 People's
                Climate March.[201][202] Leonardo DiCaprio is identified as one of the most active celebrities in the climate
                change movement. Not only did he highlight the topic at the Oscars but he is a constant source of information
                on the matter.[203] Many political figures welcome high-profile influencers such actors as Leonardo DiCaprio
                or artists to address political causes, environmental or not, "because of the high recognition that celebrities
                have", states Eric T. Kasper, an associate professor of political science. He claims that much of the public
                feel a personal connection to the stars after experiencing emotion from them in so many different ways on
                the big screens. [204] While budgets in the science and technology sector are declining as well as interest
                in newspapers and scientific journal series, it is important to have more familiar faces and voices such
                of those from celebrities to represent the importance of subjects such as climate change.[205]</p>

                earthquake and opened in early 1999.[206] During the filming of Blood Diamond, DiCaprio worked with 24 orphaned
                children from the SOS Children's Village in Maputo, Mozambique, and was said to be extremely touched by his
                interactions with the children.[207] In 2010, he donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti after the
                earthquake.[208] In April 2013, DiCaprio donated $61,000 to GLAAD, an organization which promotes the image
                of LGBT people in the media.[209] In 2016 Leonardo DiCaprio took part in an annual fundraising gala event
